    <h5>Volunteer & Suggestion</h5>
    <p>
        Over the next 10 rounds, you will be grouped randomly and anonymously with another {{ C.NUM_OTHER_PLAYERS }} participants.
        In each round, you will be randomly assigned a cost that ranges uniformly from 0 to 120.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong><span style="color: blue;">Then, you will be asked whether you would like to volunteer to contribute to the threshold. This is not a binding decision.</span></strong>  
    </p>
    <p style="margin-top: 30px;">
        On the next screen, you will be asked whether you would like to contribute. <br>
        Then, <strong><span style="color: blue;">suggestions will be presented as follows</span></strong>.
        <ul>
            <li>
                If at least {{C.NUMCONS}} volunteer, then a sample of {{C.NUMCONS}} participants will be selected and suggested to contribute. 
                All other participants will be suggested not to contribute.
            </li>
            <li>
                If fewer than {{C.NUMCONS}} volunteer, all participants will be suggested not to contribute.
            </li>
            <li>
                You are not obligated to follow any of these suggestions.
            </li>
        </ul>
        After the suggestions are made, each of you decides independently and simultaneously whether you will contribute or not, just as in the previous game.      
    </p>
    <p>
        Earnings will be determined in the same manner as were in the previous game. Your earnings will continue to be accumulated until the end of the experiment.
        Your current earnings are <strong>{{player.total_earnings}}</strong>.
    </p>

    </h5>
    <p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                If at least {{C.NUMCONS}} members in your group contribute, everyone will get {{ C.GENERAL_BENEFIT }}.
            </li>
            <li>
                If fewer than {{C.NUMCONS}} members contribute, everyone receives nothing.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <li>
            <strong>However, you will pay your cost if you contribute, regardless of if the threshold is met</strong>.
        </li>
    </p>
    <p>
        Note that your earnings each round will depend on both your own choice and the choices of other group members. <br> 
        There are four possible cases. <br>

                <strong>Each point</strong> you earn is equivalent of <strong>$0.01</strong>. 
                However, if your total earnings are negative points at the end of this experiment, your earnings will be converted to $0.
            </li>
            <li>
                You will be paid off your earnings plus participation fee ($3) when you leave the room. 
                Your payoff from this experiment will range between $0 ~ $23.
