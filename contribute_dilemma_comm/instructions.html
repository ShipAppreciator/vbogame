    <p>
		This game is different than the previous one so please reread these instructions.
        You will be grouped randomly and anonymously with
        another {{ C.NUM_OTHER_PLAYERS }}
        participants.
    </p>
    <p>
		First, you will be assigned a cost that ranges uniformly from 0 to 120.
		Then, you will be asked whether you would like to volunteer to contribute to the threshold.  
		This is not a binding decision.  
		
		In the next screen you will be asked whether you would like to contribute.
		If at least {{C.NUMCONS}} volunteer, then a sample of {{C.NUMCONS}}
		Players will be selected and suggested to contribute. All other players will be suggested not to contribute.
		You are not obligated to follow either of these suggestions.  All contributions occur independently and simultaneously.
		
        If at least {{C.NUMCONS}} of you contributes, everyone will get
        {{ C.GENERAL_BENEFIT }}. However, you will
        pay {{ player.cost }} if you contribute, regardless of if the threshold is met. If fewer than {{C.NUMCONS}}
        contributes, everyone receives nothing.
		you currently have {{player.earnings}}
