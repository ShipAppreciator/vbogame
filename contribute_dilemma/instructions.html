        Over the next 10 rounds, you will be grouped randomly and anonymously with another {{ C.NUM_OTHER_PLAYERS }} participants. <br>
        In each round, you will be randomly assigned a cost that ranges uniformly from 0 to 120. <br>
        Each of you decides independently and simultaneously whether you will contribute or not.

        <ul>
            <li>
                If at least {{C.NUMCONS}} members in your group contribute, everyone will get {{ C.GENERAL_BENEFIT }}.
            </li>
            <li>
                If fewer than {{C.NUMCONS}} members contribute, everyone receives nothing.
